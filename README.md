# Multigene Mutation Analytics Platform

An end-to-end data processing and analytics system that classifies DNA mutations as benign or pathogenic using transformer-based embeddings and machine learning pipelines.

## Overview
This project processes large genomic datasets and converts raw biological sequences into structured analytical features. The pipeline performs preprocessing, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, classification, and real-time prediction through a web interface.

The system is designed as a reusable data workflow that demonstrates data ingestion, transformation, validation, and analytics reporting.

## Key Features
- Automated ingestion of FASTA sequence datasets
- Data preprocessing and validation pipeline
- Feature engineering using contextual embeddings
- Dimensionality reduction for optimized analytics
- Machine learning classification workflow
- Real-time prediction web interface
- Reusable processed datasets for analysis

## Tech Stack
Python • Pandas • Scikit-learn • Flask • SQL concepts • Data Pipelines

## Workflow
Raw Data → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Modeling → Prediction → Visualization

## Use Case
Demonstrates how complex unstructured data can be transformed into structured analytical datasets suitable for reporting and decision making.

## Learning Outcome
Built as a data analytics pipeline focusing on:
- Data transformation
- Workflow automation
- Dataset validation
- Reproducible analytics
